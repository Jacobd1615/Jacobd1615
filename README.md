## 🔥 Featured Project: LandLink

**🏆 Government Technology Capstone Project**

A secure, fraud-resistant compensation system for communities displaced by land redevelopment. Think "humanitarian aid meets enterprise security."

### 🎯 What Makes It Special:
- **AI-Powered Verification**: Facial recognition with 90%+ confidence thresholds
- **Uncrackable Security**: Cryptographic wallet IDs with 15 trillion years to crack
- **Anti-Gaming Enforcement**: Prevents organizational misuse and weapons funding
- **Kiosk-Based Infrastructure**: Tamper-resistant verification terminals
- **PostgreSQL Backend**: Enterprise-grade database with row-level security

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
```
Backend:     Python • FastAPI • Flask • PostgreSQL • SQLAlchemy • RESTful APIs
AI/ML:       OpenCV • AWS Rekognition • Facial Recognition • Schema Discovery
Frontend:    React • Streamlit • HTML5 • CSS3 • JavaScript • Bootstrap • Tailwind
