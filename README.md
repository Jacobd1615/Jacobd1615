# 👋 Hi, I'm Jacob Dyson

### 🚀 Full Stack Software Developer | Backend Specialist

**📍 Pacific Northwest | 📧 Jacobd.pnw@gmail.com | 📱 (541)-848-8468**

Hi, I'm Jacob! Backend Developer and OSU Computer Science graduate passionate about building scalable systems with Python and advancing MLOps for data-driven solutions. I excel in developing efficient APIs, optimizing databases, and exploring cutting-edge technologies like Rust, Go, and R to create high-performance backends. My full-stack experience enhances my ability to deliver end-to-end solutions that make a real impact.

When not coding, you'll find me strategizing over chess, dominating on the lacrosse field, or diving deep into the latest DevOps tools. I'm always eager to join innovative teams and build robust backend systems that drive meaningful change.
